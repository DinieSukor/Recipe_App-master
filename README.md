# Recipe_App
The Recipe app contains prepopulated recipes that can be clicked to view full data of the recipe. 
They also can be filtered with a spinner according to their types.
The app provides edit and adding new recipe features;
however, I did not manage to send back the edited/new data back to the user. 
It was a fun assignment for me as newbie to Kotlin I and personally hope I can complete the app soon. 
Thank you for the opportunity.
